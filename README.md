My adventures in Deep Learning
I have decided to learn Python and develop skils in Deep Learning so that I can better present myself and my life skills. AI and specifically DL will be great ways for me to take a lifetime expereience and make it relavent and exciting to people I interact with. 
I will be uploading my first project soon today is 15 Nov 2020 my first project is a short fastai app that can identify 3 types of buck (deer for those that don't know the term) The images were scraped from the internet and were optimised by hand (I wanted to expereince every aspect of how this DL works) - Well here goes ... to a new beginning.
